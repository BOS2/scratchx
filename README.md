Bank of Scratch 2
=====
About
-----
Bank of Scratch is a currency for the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/ "Scratch") community. BOS (Bank of Scratch) is now being hosted on ScratchX because it enables BOS to be more secure, and have a better UI (User Interface). ScratchX enables BOS to connect to its secure servers. ScratchX has a feature called "Scratch Extensions" which make all of this possible.
