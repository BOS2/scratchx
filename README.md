Bank of Scratch 2
=====

About
-----
Bank of Scratch is a currency for the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/ "Scratch") community. BOS (Bank of Scratch) is now being hosted on ScratchX because it enables BOS to be more secure, and have a better UI (User Interface). ScratchX enables BOS to connect to its secure servers. ScratchX has a feature called "Scratch Extensions" which make all of this possible.

Bank of Scratch 1

About
-----
Bank of Scratch is a currency for the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/ "Scratch") community. BOS1 (Bank of Scratch 1) has now been removed due to lack of security and constant bugs the UI (User Interface) was also not that good, buttons would glitch and freak out. The old BOS can still be found [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/126763869/ "the old Scratch Project").

Information
-----
BOS1 ruled off the assembly lines in October 2017, being the first currency system. It was not as popular as developers had thought, but in the last month of its life some shops and users realized its potential. Quickly BOS gained over 20 users. Then the developer [Csf30816](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/csf30816/ "Csf") decided to restart BOS on ScratchX, this was mainly because some shops asked to be informed when BOS2 would be available.

How to use
-----
Sadly since BOS1 is outdated and discontinued there is no _How To_ manual anymore.
